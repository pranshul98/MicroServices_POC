# SpringBoot Application [POC #1] 

In this application I have tested out some concepts of service discovery and Eureka server with the help of couple of services I tried to make communication between them and registered their presence in a discovery server using Eureka I have also created a API gateway to separate that discovery part controllers 

So that the initial request will hit on api gateway and then it is transferred to our discovery server that then brings us the required response that we are requesting
